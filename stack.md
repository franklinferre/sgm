# Modern Web Development Stack 2025: Production-Ready Template

## Core stack versions and configuration

### Frontend Foundation
The modern frontend stack leverages **Vite 7.1.2** as the build tool, requiring Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+. This latest version brings ESM-only distribution and improved browser targets (Chrome 107+, Edge 107+, Firefox 104+, Safari 16.0+). For enhanced build performance on large projects, consider integrating Rolldown, the Rust-based bundler that delivers 15-30% faster builds.

**React 19** introduces revolutionary features that fundamentally change development patterns. The React Compiler eliminates manual optimization needs by automatically handling memoization, while Server Components enable zero-bundle server logic. The new Actions API simplifies async form handling, and the `use()` hook enables conditional resource reading in render. Combined with improved streaming SSR and hooks like `useOptimistic()` and `useActionState()`, React 19 delivers 10-40% fewer re-renders with the Compiler enabled.

**TypeScript 5.9.2** provides the type safety foundation with enhanced Node.js support through stable node20 module resolution. The upcoming TypeScript 7.0, built with native Go implementation, promises 10x performance improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Backend Infrastructure
**FastAPI with Python 3.13** brings groundbreaking performance improvements through the JIT compiler (15-20% gains) and experimental no-GIL mode for true parallelism. The framework pairs perfectly with **PostgreSQL 17.6**, featuring incremental backups, enhanced JSON support with JSON_TABLE(), and 2x performance improvement in COPY operations.

**Node.js 22.18.0 LTS** serves as the JavaScript runtime with built-in WebSocket support, stable watch mode, and native glob functionality. The LTS status ensures stability through April 2027, making it ideal for production deployments.

**Docker 28.3.4** introduces the AI Agent for intelligent container management and enhanced BuildKit capabilities. Combined with **Redis 8.0 GA**, which merges Redis Stack into a unified distribution with 87% faster commands and 2x throughput improvements, the infrastructure delivers exceptional performance.

### UI and Integration
**Mantine v7.17.8** provides 100+ customizable components with native dark theme support and full SSR compatibility. The library's 50+ hooks and accessibility-first design ensure rapid development without compromising quality. **Supabase** completes the stack with real-time authorization using Row Level Security, enhanced authentication including MFA, and enterprise features like SOC 2 Type II compliance.

## Modern development tools configuration

### Biome: Next-Generation Linting and Formatting
Biome replaces ESLint and Prettier with a single Rust-powered toolchain that's 25x faster for formatting and 15x faster for linting. The tool provides 97% Prettier compatibility while processing all directories with intelligent caching.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",
  "organizeImports": { "enabled": true },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": { "recommended": true }
  },
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 100
  }
}
```

### Model Context Protocol Integration
MCP enables standardized AI assistant connectivity across development environments. Implement MCP servers for database access, file system operations, and API integrations:

```python
from mcp import McpServer
import asyncio

server = McpServer("project-mcp-server")

@server.tool()
async def execute_database_query(query: str) -> dict:
    """Execute safe read-only database queries."""
    # Implementation with proper validation
    return await db.execute_safe_query(query)

@server.resource("file://")
async def read_project_file(uri: str) -> str:
    """Read project documentation and code files."""
    # Secure file reading implementation
    pass
```

### Container Optimization Strategy
Implement distroless images for production deployments, reducing attack surface by removing shells and package managers. Multi-stage builds separate build and runtime environments:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage with distroless
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22:nonroot
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
USER nonroot:nonroot
CMD ["dist/index.js"]
```

### Documentation Standards
Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for capturing significant decisions, C4 model for hierarchical architecture diagrams, and RFC-style documentation for major changes. Use Docusaurus v3 or Backstage for centralized documentation portals.

### Monorepo Management
For projects with 10+ packages, **Nx** provides superior caching with selective file restoration (5x faster than alternatives) and comprehensive tooling. For simpler setups, **Turborepo** offers zero-configuration operation with excellent Vercel ecosystem integration.

## Infrastructure architecture patterns

### Traefik v3 Configuration
Deploy Traefik v3.3 as the reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL, HTTP/3 support, and WebAssembly middleware capabilities:

```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3.3
    command:
      - --providers.docker=true
      - --entrypoints.websecure.address=:443
      - --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=admin@domain.com
      - --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json
      - --certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - letsencrypt:/letsencrypt
```

### Container Orchestration Selection
- **Small teams (1-10 developers)**: Docker Compose v2 with production profiles
- **Edge/IoT deployments**: K3s lightweight Kubernetes (70MB binary, 512MB RAM minimum)
- **Mixed workloads**: HashiCorp Nomad for containers and non-containerized applications
- **Enterprise scale**: Full Kubernetes with service mesh

### MinIO S3-Compatible Storage
Deploy MinIO for object storage with erasure coding and high availability:

```yaml
services:
  minio:
    image: minio/minio:latest
    command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: minioadmin
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MINIO_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - minio_data:/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live"]
```

### Message Queue Architecture
- **Low volume (<1K msg/sec)**: Redis Streams built into existing Redis infrastructure
- **Medium volume (1K-10K msg/sec)**: RabbitMQ with clustering for reliable delivery
- **High performance**: NATS JetStream achieving 11M+ messages/sec
- **Event streaming (100K+ msg/sec)**: Apache Kafka for long-term storage and replay

### Observability Stack
Deploy the complete Grafana stack for monitoring:
- **Prometheus** for metrics (4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores for small environments)
- **Loki** for log aggregation with LogQL queries
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** for unified instrumentation

## Security and authentication implementation

### Passkeys and WebAuthn
Implement passwordless authentication with browser-native passkeys, achieving 550% growth in adoption. Use SimpleWebAuthn for easy integration:

```javascript
const options = generateRegistrationOptions({
  rpName: 'Your App',
  rpID: 'yourdomain.com',
  userName: username,
  authenticatorSelection: {
    authenticatorAttachment: 'platform',
    userVerification: 'required',
    residentKey: 'preferred'
  }
});
```

### Zero-Trust Architecture
Implement service mesh with Istio or Linkerd for automatic mTLS between services. Integrate Open Policy Agent (OPA) for fine-grained authorization:

```rego
package app.authz
default allow = false

allow {
    input.method == "GET"
    input.user.verified == true
    time.now_ns() < input.user.token_exp
    input.user.role in ["admin", "user"]
}
```

### Container Security Pipeline
Integrate Trivy for vulnerability scanning in CI/CD with automatic fail on critical vulnerabilities. Implement Cosign for image signing and Falco for runtime protection:

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'myapp:${{ github.sha }}'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    exit-code: '1'
```

### Secrets Management
Deploy HashiCorp Vault for enterprise environments or Infisical for developer-focused teams. Implement automatic rotation every 30 days with audit logging:

```python
# Vault dynamic database credentials
vault write database/roles/readonly \
    db_name=postgresql \
    creation_statements="CREATE ROLE \"{{name}}\" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}'" \
    default_ttl="1h" \
    max_ttl="24h"
```

## AI/ML integration patterns

### LLM Integration Architecture
Implement streaming responses with Server-Sent Events for real-time token delivery. Target <100ms per token for optimal user experience. Use hybrid RAG with vector similarity and keyword filtering for 20-40% better relevance.

### Vector Database Selection
- **Small datasets (<10M vectors)**: pgvector with existing PostgreSQL
- **Real-time filtering**: Qdrant with sub-40ms latency at scale
- **Enterprise**: Weaviate with GraphQL API and hybrid search
- **Managed solution**: Pinecone for zero-ops scaling

### Model Serving Strategy
Convert models to ONNX for 3-5x faster inference. Deploy with WebGPU backend for 75% memory reduction:

```python
torch.onnx.export(
    model, dummy_input, "model.onnx",
    opset_version=17,
    dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'}}
)
```

### Cost Optimization
- Use 4-bit quantization to reduce GPU requirements by 50-75%
- Implement continuous batching for 10-20x better throughput
- Deploy spot instances for 90% cost savings on non-critical workloads
- Cache embeddings with 1-hour TTL in Redis
